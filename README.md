# HTML:

This HTML code creates a friendly webpage for showing toast notifications. It features handy checkboxes that let you easily switch between different types of notifications: help, success, warning, and error. Each type of notification is neatly organized within its own div labeled as toast-item, and within each div, you'll find a tailored toast with a convenient close button. Plus, there's a row of cheerful toast icons at the bottom, ready to help you manage the display of each notification type with a simple click. 

# CSS:

This code crafts a stylish toast notification system using CSS. It introduces a range of custom properties, such as background colors, transitions, and animation delays, for a personalized touch. Leveraging flexbox for layout, it ensures a tidy arrangement while animating toast items to smoothly slide in and out. Each toast type—help, success, warning, and error—receives its distinct flair with custom styling, encompassing background colors and icons. Finally, it incorporates checkbox inputs for effortlessly toggling the display of toast items according to their type.
